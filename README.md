# Technical test Ringover

This is the technical test I made for Ringover.

## Questions/answer

You'll find my answers in the file Test_tech_reponses.pdf

## Todolist project

You need to serve the files via a webserver to launch the project for CORS reason, I made the choice to use Javascript modules for some reasons like the possibilitie to import js files inside others and use top level await feature.

```
python3 -m http.server
```
